🔎Project overview🔍
: This project was built with HTML and mainly Tailwind CSS, also using an additional stylesheet for some styles that I couldn't format with Tailwind CSS.
: The project consists of 9 different sections, each with their own styling and different layouts.
: I mainly used <section></section> and <div></div> tags to create a clean and user friendly HTML sheet, also using additional tags like <span></span>, <ul></ul>, <p></p>, <h></h>, and even <img> securing a good   
  naming convention for each element in the HTML sheet.
: I used Tailwind version 2.2.16 because of it's easy installation and easy to understand designs.
: The website is designed to completely change the layout when the screen size is reduced to under 640px.
: All the provided links in the website footer is up to date and work.
