## 🔎 Project Overview 🔍  

- This project was built with **HTML** and mainly **Tailwind CSS**, with an additional stylesheet for styles that couldn't be formatted with Tailwind.  
- The project consists of **9 different sections**, each with unique styling and layouts.  
- HTML structure primarily uses `<section>` and `<div>` tags for a **clean and user-friendly** document, along with additional elements like:  
  - `<span>`, `<ul>`, `<p>`, `<h1-h6>`, and `<img>` for better content organization.  
- **Tailwind CSS version 2.2.16** was used for its easy installation and straightforward styling.  
- The website is **fully responsive**, changing layout when the screen size is reduced to **under 640px**.  
- I used different **icons and pictures**, so I created two separate folders named **Icons** and **Images** for better organization.  
- All the **footer links** are up-to-date and functional.
